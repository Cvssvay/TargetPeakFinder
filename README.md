# Targeted LC-MS Analysis for Metabolite Concentration Quantification Using Deep Learning

The project involves targeted analysis for peak detection to identify small compounds such as metabolites using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Raw LC-MS data is converted into mzML files, which are then used as input for deep learning models. These models are developed to accurately identify peaks and calculate the area under each peak, corresponding to the concentration of metabolites. Advanced deep learning techniques are employed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of peak identification and metabolite quantification.
